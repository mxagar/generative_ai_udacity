# Generative AI and Machine Learning Papers

This module contains my notes on selected and relevant papers in the field of Generative AI.

The initial list was taken from [davidADSP/Generative_Deep_Learning_2nd_Edition](https://github.com/davidADSP/Generative_Deep_Learning_2nd_Edition), which is the repository for the book [Generative Deep Learning, 2nd Edition, by David Foster (O'Reilly)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/).

I have extended the list in [`history.csv`](./assets/history.csv).

The map of an initial list can be visualized as follows (image from David Foster):
