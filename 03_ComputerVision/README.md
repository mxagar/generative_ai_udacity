# Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree: Computer Vision and Generative AI

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608).

The Nanodegree has 4 modules:

1. Generative AI Fundamentals.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation.
3. Computer Vision and Generative AI.
4. Building Generative AI Solutions.

This folder & guide refer to the **third module**: Computer Vision and Generative AI.

Overview of Contents:

## 1. Introduction to Image Generation

Introductory concepts:

- Discriminative vs. Generative Models
  - Discriminative models learn decision boundaries
  - Generative models learn distributions where the y sample from
  - Mathematically they capture related but different models
  - Discriminative models cannot generate, but generative models can somehow discriminate
- Images are high-dimensional points
  - Realistic images are really points in a large vast of noise
  - Generative models learn *islands in an universe of noise*
  -
