# Semantic Kernel

The Coursera course shows how to use [microsoft/semantic-kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), which is is the Microsoft version of LangChain.

Here, in [`azure-chat-demo/`](./azure-chat-demo/), the repository [alfredodeza/azure-chat-demo](https://github.com/alfredodeza/azure-chat-demo) from the instructor Alfredo Deza is cloned.

The big problem of Semantic Kernel is that the current version is significantly different from the one in the course. Additionally, LangChain seems to have become more popular.

Therefore, I tried to port the code to LangChain; check [`../04_langchain.ipynb`](../04_langchain.ipynb).
