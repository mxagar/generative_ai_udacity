# Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree: Personal Notes

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608).

The Nanodegree asssumes basic data analysis skills with data science python libraries and databases, and has 4 modules that build up on those skills; each module has its corresponding folder in this repository with its guide Markdown file:

1. Generative AI Fundamentals: [`01_Fundamentals_GenAI`](./01_Fundamentals_GenAI/README.md).
    - Foundation Models
    - Fine-Tuning
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation: [`02_LLMs`](./02_LLMs/README.md).
    - Transformers and LLMs
    - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbots
3. Computer Vision and Generative AI: [`03_ComputerVision`](./03_ComputerVision/README.md).
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    - Vision Transformers
    - Diffusion Models
4. Building Generative AI Solutions: [`04_BuildingSolutions`](./04_BuildingSolutions/README.md).
    - Vector Databases
    - LangChain and Agents

Additionally, it is necessary to submit and pass some projects to get the certification:

- Project 1: Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model - TBD.
- Project 2: Build Your Own Custom Chatbot - TBD.
- Project 3: AI Photo Editing with Inpainting - TBD.
- Project 4: Personalized Real Estate Agent - TBD.

## Setup

A regular python environment with the usual data science packages should suffice (i.e., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.); any special/additional packages and their installation commands are introduced in the guides. A recipe to set up a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with my current packages is the following:

```bash
# Create the necessary Python environment
# NOTE: specific folders might require their own environment
# and have their own requirements.txt
conda create --name ds pip python=3.10
conda activate ds
pip install -r requirements.txt

# When the repository is cloned, initialize and update the submodules 
git clone https://github.com/mxagar/generative_ai_udacity
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
