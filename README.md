# Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree: Personal Notes

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608).

The Nanodegree asssumes basic data analysis skills with data science python libraries and databases, and has 4 modules that build up on those skills; each module has its corresponding folder in this repository with its guide Markdown file:

1. Generative AI Fundamentals: [`01_Fundamentals_GenAI`](./01_Fundamentals_GenAI/README.md).
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation: [`02_LLMs`](./02_LLMs/README.md).
3. Computer Vision and Generative AI: [`03_ComputerVision`](./03_ComputerVision/README.md).
4. Building Generative AI Solutions: [`04_BuildingSolutions`](./04_BuildingSolutions/README.md).

Additionally, it is necessary to submit and pass some projects to get the certification:

- Project 1: TBD.
- Project 2: TBD.
- Project 3: TBD.
- Project 4: TBD.

A regular python environment with the usual data science packages should suffice (i.e., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.); any special/additional packages and their installation commands are introduced in the guides. A recipe to set up a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with my current packages is the following:

```bash
conda create --name ds pip python=3.10
conda activate ds
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
