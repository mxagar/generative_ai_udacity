# Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree: Building Generative AI Solutions

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608).

The Nanodegree has 3 modules:

1. Generative AI Fundamentals.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
3. Multimodal AI Solutions / Computer Vision and Generative AI.

This folder & guide refer to the new **third module**: Multimodal AI Solutions.
