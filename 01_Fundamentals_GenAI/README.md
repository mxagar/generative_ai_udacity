# Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree: Generative AI Fundamentals

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608).

The Nanodegree has 4 modules:

1. Generative AI Fundamentals.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation.
3. Computer Vision and Generative AI.
4. Building Generative AI Solutions.

This folder & guide refer to the **first module**: Generative AI Fundamentals.
